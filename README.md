# Go Language Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome! This repository contains my hands-on practice, experiments, and summaries as I learn the Go programming language. Whether you’re a fellow learner, an experienced Go developer, or just curious, I hope you’ll find the code, explanations, and organized structure useful for your own journey.

## 🌱 Why Go?

Go (also known as Golang) is a modern programming language designed by Google for simplicity, performance, and scalability. Some of its highlights include:

- **Statically-typed & compiled:** Ensures code safety and blazing fast execution.
- **Concise syntax:** Easy to read and maintain.
- **Powerful concurrency support:** Goroutines and channels for scalable programs.
- **Robust standard library:** For web, testing, and more.
- **Widespread usage:** From cloud infrastructure to backend services (think Docker, Kubernetes, and more!).

## 📚 What’s Inside

This repo is organized by foundational concepts and hands-on exercises:

| Topic            | Description                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| 01_hello_world   | Your first Go program!         |
| variables        | Declare, initialize, and use variables. |
| constants        | Work with immutable values.     |
| simple_values    | Working with basic types (ints, floats, strings). |
| functions        | Basic and advanced usages.      |
| variadic         | Passing variable numbers of arguments. |
| closures         | Functions as values (closures). |
| if-else          | Conditional logic.              |
| for              | Loop constructs.                |
| switch           | Switch-case structures.         |
| arrays           | Fixed-size sequential collections. |
| slices           | Dynamic arrays in Go.           |
| maps             | Key-value store for fast lookups. |
| range            | Idiomatic iteration of data structures. |
